# Streaming Text Generation with SSE in Golang

This repository contains code and examples for implementing a streaming text generation interface using Server-Sent Events (SSE) in Golang.

## Directory Structure

- `exponential-distribution-plot`: Contains a Python script for generating a plot of the exponential distribution used for simulating word generation intervals.
- `simple-example`: A simple Golang example demonstrating basic SSE functionality with an HTML client.
- `final-implementation`: The final Golang implementation with simulated word generation.

## How to Use

Each directory contains its own `README.md` with instructions on how to run the code within that directory.
